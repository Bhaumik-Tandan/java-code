You must set up a library information system that keeps track of book information. 
A package with the following two classes should be included in your program: Book and Test.
The information regarding books will be contained in the Book. 
The following attributes can be used to represent a book: int bookID, 
String bookName, double rentPriceWeekly, and String bookDescription.
Remember to include public "set" and "get" methods in the Book class to access these encapsulated attributes.
The method main will be in the class Test, as well as a method named displayBooksArrayInfo.
The method displayBooksArrayInfo takes an array of Book references to print 
out the information of the contents of the array and returns no value. 
This method calls the “get” methods of class Book to access the related information.
In main, read the number of the Books in the library and define a suitable array 
called BooksArray to store the Book references.
Then, make each content of the array refer to new Book instances. 
Do not forget to read and set the data for these Books.
Finally, 
use the displayBooksArrayInfo function to print the data for each array element. 
Then, in class Book, add the following attribute: boolean isAvailable. 
This data member refers whether the corresponding Book is available to rent or not.
In class Book, also add a public method called calculateWeeklyIncome. 
This method takes no parameter and returns the weekly revenue of a Book.
